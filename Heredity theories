<h1>Mendel's heredity theories</h1>
<p>Mendel, while doing his experiments, declared theories about how traits are passed down.
Mendel noticed how some traits show up in one generation but some were not in the same generation but in later generations. Mendel
theorized that the color in pea plants are inherited in a double dose, meaning that one trait comes from each parent. 
Two of Mendel's theories also included the Principle of Segregation and the Principle of Independent Assortment. The Principle of 
Segregation proposed the separation of paired factors with a gamete recieving one trait but not the other. The Principle of Independent
Assortment stated that when gametes are formed, alleles are distributed among cells independently. Mendel's Principle of Segregation also 
connects to another theory he discovered: dominate traits are passed down in a ratio of 3:1. </p>
