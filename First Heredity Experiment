<h1>Mendel's first heredity experiments</h1>
<p>Mendel began his experiments with garden peas because they could easily self-pollinate. 
He started with hybridization by focusing on a few varieties of peas with clearly distinguishable characteristics.
Mendel decided to cross plants that always produced green seeds with plants that always produced yellow seeds.
He noticed that the offspring were all yellow, but the grandchildren of the original plants showed both green and yellow.
There were five or six yellow plants and two or three green plants. 
Mendel concluded that traits can be passed down. </p>
