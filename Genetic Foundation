<h1>Mendel's legacy on modern genetics</h1>
<p>Mendel laid the foundation with his discoveries for further genetic research in plant breeding and inherited traits.
To recap, Mendel discovered when he bred plants, the first generation of offspring was all tall plants.
Mendel determined the names "dominant" and "recessive" to describe what was happening.
Mendel, after discovering the dominant and recessive traits, noticed a ratio of 3:1, showing the dominant traits will show up 3 times more likely than the recessive.
Mendel's 3:1 ratio connects to his Principle of Segregation.
